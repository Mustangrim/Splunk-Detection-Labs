## Knowledge Check

**Q1:** What is the date of the most recent event?  
📅 **A:** 5/27/20

**Q2:** What is the username of the most recent failed login?  
👤 **A:** ubuntu

**Q3:** What is the source of the most recent event?  
📄 **A:** `/var/log/splunk/default/linux_s_30DAY.log`

---

### 6. Run a Multi-Term Search

Add another keyword to narrow down results:

```spl
failed root
```

---

### 7. Run a Quoted Phrase Search

Search for an exact phrase using quotes:

```spl
"failed password for root"
```

This will match only those events that include the **exact phrase**.

**Result:**  
📌 **7282** matching events
