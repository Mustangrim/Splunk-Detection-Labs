### 4. Run a Basic Search

Search for all events with the word `failed`.

```

Make sure Time Picker is set to **All time**.

### 5. Analyze Search Results

Once you search for `failed`, observe the following:
- Event timeline (top bar)
- Highlighted fields: `host`, `source`, `sourcetype`
- Sample event breakdown
